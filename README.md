This code is for the canyon-fan landscape morphodynamic evolution model. Here we consider a linked canyon-fan system in the setting of a Basin and Range province, basing our work loosely on Rainbow Canyon and Panamint Valley, Death Valley National Park, USA. The canyon is mixed bedrock-alluvial, and is incising into a plateau undergoing relative uplift. The fan is purely alluvial, and is part of a bajada complex in an adjacent valley undergoing relative subsidence.
